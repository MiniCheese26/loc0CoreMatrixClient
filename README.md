# loc0NetMatrixClient
A Matrix Client Built With .Net Core [WIP]
If you find this right now, this is **very early** development. Very early in a sense that I started coding this one day before creating this repo.

# Current Progress
* Login with username/password
* Join Rooms

# Todo
* Figure out syncing
* Create a listener for messages
* Create a class for interacting with rooms
* Upload content
* Allow joining rooms from invites
* Allow encryption to be used
* Whatever the future tells me to do!
